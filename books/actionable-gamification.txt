unlike most games with a computer interface life does not have
  clear objectives
  visual cues to tell me what to do
  or feedback mechanics to show me how I have advanced in it

one has to design their own game
  along with clear goals
  meaningful objectives
  and creative feedback systems

Coonradt:
  "Why would people pay for the privilege of working harder at
  their chosen sport or recreational pursuit
  than they would work at a job where they were being paid?"

  He then got to five conclusions that led to hobbies being more preferable to work

    Clearly defined goals
    Better scorekeeping and scorecards
    More frequent feedback
    A higher degree of personal choice of methods
    Consistent coaching

Human-Focused Design: The Better Term for Gamification

  Most systems are inherently "function-focused"
    designed to get the job done quickly
    like a factory that assumes its workers will do their jobs because they are required to
    not because they necessarily want to perform the associated tasks

  Human-Focused Design emphasizes that people aren't rudimentary cogs in a system.
    We have feelings, ambitions, insecurities, and reasons for whether or not we want to do certain things.
    Human-Focused Design optimizes for these feelings, motivations, and engagement as the basic foundation for designing the overall system as well as its functions.

it is called "Gamification" because
  the gaming industry was the first to master human focused design

some kids who appear to not have discipline or work ethic
  somehow sacrifice sleep and other stuff to do pointless grunt for fun
    because they see the bigger picture in those cases, the 'why' they are doing it
      they like the sense of acomplishment as well as the creativity to make a strategy

some gamification professionals misunderstood gamification as just
  PBLs: Points, Badges and Leaderboards
    but these are just a shell of a game experience
      when asked, gamers say they plays games because of
        the elements of strategy
        great ways to spend time with friends
        possible challenges one can set for oneself

      it is how, when and why these appear in the game what matters

  calling something a quest instead of a task
    thinking that just because of its name automatically makes it fun
      that is misunderstanding gamification
        playful attitudes only goes so far

extrinsic motivation
  you are motivated because of a goal or reward

intrinsic motivation
  the activity itself is fun and exciting
    with or without a reward

a good designer thinks first of this:
  how do I want my users to feel?
    Do I want them to be proud?
    Should they be scared?
    Anxious?
  once they think of their goal for the intented experience
    only then they of start to think about
      how the game mechanics and elements can help the goal
        because mechanics and elements are only a means to an end

octalysis: the framework that makes games engaging

  some of these drives make the user feel powerful but don't create urgency
  others create urgency, obsession, even addiction but make the user feel bad

  some drives are short-term extrinsically focused
  others are long-term intrinsically focused

  8 core drives of gamification
    meaning
    accomplishment
    ownership
    scarcity
    avoidance
    unpredictability
    social influence
    empowerment

  core drive 1: meaning / meaning & calling
    person believes they are doing something greater than themselves
    or believe they were chosen to take that action
    example:
      people contribute to wikipedia because they believe that way they protect humanity's knowledge

  core drive 2: development & accomplishment
    is our internal drive to make progress, develop skills and achieve mastery to overcome challenges
    a trophy without a challenge has no meaning at all
    this is where majority of PBLs focus on because is the easiest to design

  core drive 3: empowerment of creativity & feedback
    person in a creative process repeatedly figuring new things out and trying different combinations
    apart from expressing creativity people also need to
      see the results of their creativity, receive feedback and adjust in turn
    if these techniques are properly designed to empower users to be more creative
      then you don't have to continously add more content to a game to keep it fresh and engaging
        "the brain entertains itself"

  core drive 4: ownership & possession
    users feel they own/control something and want to improve in what they own
    this applies to things the user spends time on customizing. example: their avatar/profile

  core drive 5: social influence & relatedness
    people are motivated by social elements like
      mentorship, social acceptance, social feedback, companionship, competition, and envy
    when seeing someone is really good at a skill or owns something extraordinary
      you become driven to attain the same

  core drive 6: scarcity & impatience
    people want things that are rare, exclusive, or immediatly unattainable
    not being able to get something right now but in some hours makes them think about it all day
    example
      many people wanted to join facebook at the start simply because it felt very exclusive at that time

  core drive 7: unpredictability & curiosity
    being constantly engaged because you don't know what is going to happen next
    your brain pays more attention when something does not fall in your regular pattern recognition cycles
    this is the primary core drive behind gambling addictions

  core drive 8: loss & avoidance
    motivation to avoid something negative from happening
    present in special offers for limited time
      people feel that if they don't act immediatly they would lose the opportunity to act forever

white hat and black hat gamification

  based on the octalysis you can notice that
    the top parts are considered positive motivations (called white hat gamification)
      engaging because
        express your creativity
        feels successful at mastering a skill

    the bottom parts are considered negative motivations (called black hat gamification)
      engaging because
        you don't know what will happen next
        you constantly fear losing something
        you struggle to attain things you can't have

      it will often leave a bad taste in your mouth
        even if you are consistently motivated to take these actions

  being black hat doesn't necessarily mean that is bad
    they are at the end just motivations that can produce healthy results
      e.g. some people use those to go to the gym, eat healthier

sensation: the hidden ninth core drive

  is the physical pleasure obtained by taking an action
  all the other core drives are psychological while this one is physical

how to apply octalysis to actual systems

  think about how a product or experience uses the 8 core drives
  identify the game mechanics and techniques used to activate them

  example with facebook
    meaning
      lacks epic meaning
    accomplishment
      completed profile, more friends, increased likes and comments
    empowerment
      sharing creative content
    ownership
      IKEA effect, memories
    social influence
      envy cloud
    scarcity
      inner circles
    unpredictability
      refreshing content
    avoidance
      sunk cost tragedy

  another example with candy crush
    meaning
      lacks epic meaning
    accomplishment
      1-3 stars, reaching high levels
    empowerment
      constantly looking for better combos and planning boosters
    ownership
      own quest to accumulate more points and boosters
    social influence
      see friend progress
    scarcity
      countdown timer/moves, waiting for the good gems
    unpredictability
      unpredictable gems, random combos
    avoidance
      avoiding loss (?)

quick intro to level 2 octalysis and beyond

  optimizing experiences across all four phases of the player/user journey

  the phases are
    discovery
      why people would even want to try the experience
    onboarding
      where users learn the rules and tools to play the game
    scaffolding
      the regular journey of repeated actions towards a goal
    engame
      how do you retain your experienced users

  if at any of the phases none of the 8 Core Drives are present
    there is no reason for the user to move on to the next phase
    and the user simply drops out

  the reason you are using a product in day 1
    is often different from the reason you are using the product in day 100

explicit gamification
  uses strategies that use applications that are obviously game-like
  users know they are playing a game
  e.g. McDonald's monopoly game
        it's a game but the purpose is 
          to get people go back to McDonald's
  pros
    more freedom of creativity for designers because users know they are playing a game
  cons
    could be seen as childish, non-serious, distracting

implicit gamification
  e.g. linkedin progress bar, competitive bidding and feedback on ebay
  pros
    easier to implement and appropiate in more contexts
  cons
    convenient implementation can lead to lazy design

fields of gamification in industries
  product gamification
    is making your product more engaging, fun and inspirational through game design
    users today are less tolerant to badly designed products

    remember: no one *has* to play a game, but they *have* to go to work
                design your product so that users are compelled to use it

    focus on making reasons for people to use your product (traction)
      don't focus too much on what the user can do with your product
      focus on why your user why would want to do those things

  workplace gamification
    creating environment and systems that inspire and motivate people to their work
      some people show up to work to earn their paycheck and not lose their jobs
        so these people work only hard enough to do that

        to counteract this, consider that
          everyone can actually be motivated for something that is worth their cause
          is bad environmental and cultural design that demotivates them

  marketing gamification
    creating marketing campaings that engage users in an unique experience for your product/brand

    social media marketing is to create trust in your first unknown product
      but also have in mind social media is merely a channel for engaging content
        so social media alone does not motivate the user

  lifestyle gamification
    involves applying gamification principles and the 8 Core Drives
      into daily habits and activities like
        managing your to-do list, exercising more often, waking up on time
        eating healthier, learning a new language, etc

The First Core Drive - Epic Meaning & Calling (white hat core)

  people are motivated because they believe they are engaged in something bigger than themselves

    games often do this: _you are the only one qualified to save the world_

  people who police content uploaded to wikipedia do it because of this core
    they feel they are protecting humanity's knowledge: something greater than themselves
      they can see themselves as heroes of a grander story
      it's not necessarily because it benefits directly

    these people often are more likely to donate to wikipedia
      this already coming from core drive 4: ownership & possession

  you want to tell very early exactly why the user should participate in your mission

  Apple is one company that try to sell a higher meaning
    the commercial against IBM in 1984 is one of the most successful in history
      but that commercial and another one about think different
        those never talked about specs or computers
          they sold a vision where others sold how powerful their computers are

  Waze is another example on how a product can add Epic Meaning & Calling
    by showing a simple image where knights fight a huge snake monster
      where the snake monster is the line of cars generated by traffic
      and the knights are the people using the waze app
        now people using it feel they are helping a community fight with trafic
          it works because deep down we all hate traffic

      even at the start when it was inaccurate
        instead of people thinking that they have to delete the app
          they think: the map is broken! i need to go fix it!
            so users actually become forgiving for some errors when there is a mission

  Chinese culture use the core 1 in parenting
    they have a believe where from the moment you are born you are indebted to your parents
      who you owe your life and existence
        so you must do everything possible to honor them

  game techniques within Epic Meaning & Calling
    narrative (game technique #10)
      gives context about why you should play the game
      introducing a story is effective to instill Epic Meaning & Calling

    humanity hero (game technique #27)
      example with TOM'shoes
        sends a pair of shoes to a kid in a third world country when you set an order with them
          making people feel they can help unpriviledged kids when they buy is extremely motivating
          when wearing those shoes they feel they communicate they help the world as well

      if you can tie your system to a cause that many people care about
        you can build an entire business on the goodwill of others

    elitism (game technique #26)
      if your users form a prideful group based on beliefs, common interests, ethnicity
        they want to secure the pride of the group by taking specific actions
        they will also try to frustrate their rivals
          by creating an outside enemy people bond and do actions in frenzies
            e.g. school group universities
            e.g. kiva.org with their stats on who donated more: christians or atheists

    beginner's luck (game technique #23)
      e.g. finding a powerful weapon on the first day that cannot be easily obtained
            motivates a player to keep going with the new game

    free lunch (game technique #24)
      giving something for free to selected people
        in such way that binds them to a larger theme

      e.g. Spoleto was giving free lunch to women who order with the phrase "I'm beatiful"

  believability is the key
    you turn people off when your appear disingenious in your efforts to create meaning
      a fast food company shouldn't market: "eating our food protects your health and your family"

The Second Core Drive - Development & Accomplishment (white hat core)

  people are driven by a sense of growth and a need to accomplish a targeted goal

  many people have memories of teachers giving them gold stars
    and those are not real prizes but children often get really motivated with these

  games break down the user challenges into stages
    to help the user feel like there is always progress

  our brains naturally desire to achieve goals and experience growth
    in order to feel that real progress in life is being made

  they key to the second core drive is to make sure
    users are proud of overcoming the challenges that are set out for them

  see games as "unnecesary obstacles that we volunteer to tackle"

  challenges and limitations are what makes a game fun
    by adding unnecesary obstacles
      the player feels acomplished once such challenges are overcome

  game techniques within Development & Accomplishment
    torture break (game technique #66)
      a user must wait some time regardless of their actions
        (explored also in core drive 6: scarcity & impatience)

    countdown timer (game technique #65) and last mile drive (game technique #53)
      the user feels is so close to reach the goal that it rushes to complete it

    achievement symbol (game technique #2)
      a certificate you receive from an authority in your space for your work

    * these techniques were explained when the author used the eBay site

  for a user buying in eBay is the feeling of winning an auction that drives them to buy as well
    "you are not paying to purchase, you are paying to play"
      it's like paying to get powerful weapons in a game and feeling awesome because of it

You could apply octalysis framework to things like parenting
  usually they use 2 core drives
      Core Drive 2: Development & Accomplishment
        reward when the child behaves
      Core Drive 8: Loss & Avoidance
        punish/ground when the child does not behave

* If there is only one thing you remember after reading this book
  it should be to focus on motivation by thinking through the 8 Core Drives
  instead of focusing on features and functionalities
