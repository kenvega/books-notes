unlike most games with a computer interface life does not have
  clear objectives
  visual cues to tell me what to do
  or feedback mechanics to show me how I have advanced in it

one has to design their own game
  along with clear goals
  meaningful objectives
  and creative feedback systems

Coonradt:
  "Why would people pay for the privilege of working harder at
  their chosen sport or recreational pursuit
  than they would work at a job where they were being paid?"

  He then got to five conclusions that led to hobbies being more preferable to work

    Clearly defined goals
    Better scorekeeping and scorecards
    More frequent feedback
    A higher degree of personal choice of methods
    Consistent coaching

Human-Focused Design: The Better Term for Gamification

  Most systems are inherently "function-focused"
    designed to get the job done quickly
    like a factory that assumes its workers will do their jobs because they are required to
    not because they necessarily want to perform the associated tasks

  Human-Focused Design emphasizes that people aren't rudimentary cogs in a system.
    We have feelings, ambitions, insecurities, and reasons for whether or not we want to do certain things.
    Human-Focused Design optimizes for these feelings, motivations, and engagement as the basic foundation for designing the overall system as well as its functions.
