unlike most games with a computer interface life does not have
  clear objectives
  visual cues to tell me what to do
  or feedback mechanics to show me how I have advanced in it

one has to design their own game
  along with clear goals
  meaningful objectives
  and creative feedback systems

Coonradt:
  "Why would people pay for the privilege of working harder at
  their chosen sport or recreational pursuit
  than they would work at a job where they were being paid?"

  He then got to five conclusions that led to hobbies being more preferable to work

    Clearly defined goals
    Better scorekeeping and scorecards
    More frequent feedback
    A higher degree of personal choice of methods
    Consistent coaching

Human-Focused Design: The Better Term for Gamification

  Most systems are inherently "function-focused"
    designed to get the job done quickly
    like a factory that assumes its workers will do their jobs because they are required to
    not because they necessarily want to perform the associated tasks

  Human-Focused Design emphasizes that people aren't rudimentary cogs in a system.
    We have feelings, ambitions, insecurities, and reasons for whether or not we want to do certain things.
    Human-Focused Design optimizes for these feelings, motivations, and engagement as the basic foundation for designing the overall system as well as its functions.

it is called "Gamification" because
  the gaming industry was the first to master human focused design

some kids who appear to not have discipline or work ethic
  somehow sacrifice sleep and other stuff to do pointless grunt for fun
    because they see the bigger picture in those cases, the 'why' they are doing it
      they like the sense of acomplishment as well as the creativity to make a strategy

some gamification professionals misunderstood gamification as just
  PBLs: Points, Badges and Leaderboards
    but these are just a shell of a game experience
      when asked, gamers say they plays games because of
        the elements of strategy
        great ways to spend time with friends
        possible challenges one can set for oneself

      it is how, when and why these appear in the game what matters

  calling something a quest instead of a task
    thinking that just because of its name automatically makes it fun
      that is misunderstanding gamification
        playful attitudes only goes so far

extrinsic motivation
  you are motivated because of a goal or reward

intrinsic motivation
  the activity itself is fun and exciting
    with or without a reward
