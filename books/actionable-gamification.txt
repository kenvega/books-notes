unlike most games with a computer interface life does not have
  clear objectives
  visual cues to tell me what to do
  or feedback mechanics to show me how I have advanced in it

one has to design their own game
  along with clear goals
  meaningful objectives
  and creative feedback systems

Coonradt:
  "Why would people pay for the privilege of working harder at
  their chosen sport or recreational pursuit
  than they would work at a job where they were being paid?"

  He then got to five conclusions that led to hobbies being more preferable to work

    Clearly defined goals
    Better scorekeeping and scorecards
    More frequent feedback
    A higher degree of personal choice of methods
    Consistent coaching

Human-Focused Design: The Better Term for Gamification

  Most systems are inherently "function-focused"
    designed to get the job done quickly
    like a factory that assumes its workers will do their jobs because they are required to
    not because they necessarily want to perform the associated tasks

  Human-Focused Design emphasizes that people aren't rudimentary cogs in a system.
    We have feelings, ambitions, insecurities, and reasons for whether or not we want to do certain things.
    Human-Focused Design optimizes for these feelings, motivations, and engagement as the basic foundation for designing the overall system as well as its functions.

it is called "Gamification" because
  the gaming industry was the first to master human focused design

some kids who appear to not have discipline or work ethic
  somehow sacrifice sleep and other stuff to do pointless grunt for fun
    because they see the bigger picture in those cases, the 'why' they are doing it
      they like the sense of acomplishment as well as the creativity to make a strategy

some gamification professionals misunderstood gamification as just
  PBLs: Points, Badges and Leaderboards
    but these are just a shell of a game experience
      when asked, gamers say they plays games because of
        the elements of strategy
        great ways to spend time with friends
        possible challenges one can set for oneself

      it is how, when and why these appear in the game what matters

  calling something a quest instead of a task
    thinking that just because of its name automatically makes it fun
      that is misunderstanding gamification
        playful attitudes only goes so far

extrinsic motivation
  you are motivated because of a goal or reward

intrinsic motivation
  the activity itself is fun and exciting
    with or without a reward

a good designer thinks first of this:
  how do I want my users to feel?
    Do I want them to be proud?
    Should they be scared?
    Anxious?
  once they think of their goal for the intented experience
    only then they of start to think about
      how the game mechanics and elements can help the goal
        because mechanics and elements are only a means to an end

octalysis: the framework that makes games engaging

  some of these drives make the user feel powerful but don't create urgency
  others create urgency, obsession, even addiction but make the user feel bad

  some drives are short-term extrinsically focused
  others are long-term intrinsically focused

  8 core drives of gamification
    meaning
    accomplishment
    ownership
    scarcity
    avoidance
    unpredictability
    social influence
    empowerment

  core drive 1: meaning / meaning & calling
    person believes they are doing something greater than themselves
    or believe they were chosen to take that action
    example:
      people contribute to wikipedia because they believe that way they protect humanity's knowledge

  core drive 2: development & accomplishment
    is our internal drive to make progress, develop skills and achieve mastery to overcome challenges
    a trophy without a challenge has no meaning at all
    this is where majority of PBLs focus on because is the easiest to design

  core drive 3: empowerment of creativity & feedback
    person in a creative process repeatedly figuring new things out and trying different combinations
    apart from expressing creativity people also need to
      see the results of their creativity, receive feedback and adjust in turn
    if these techniques are properly designed to empower users to be more creative
      then you don't have to continously add more content to a game to keep it fresh and engaging
        "the brain entertains itself"

  core drive 4: ownership & possession
    users feel they own/control something and want to improve in what they own
    this applies to things the user spends time on customizing. example: their avatar/profile

  core drive 5: social influence & relatedness
    people are motivated by social elements like
      mentorship, social acceptance, social feedback, companionship, competition, and envy
    when seeing someone is really good at a skill or owns something extraordinary
      you become driven to attain the same

  core drive 6: scarcity & impatience
    people want things that are rare, exclusive, or immediatly unattainable
    not being able to get something right now but in some hours makes them think about it all day
    example
      many people wanted to join facebook at the start simply because it felt very exclusive at that time

  core drive 7: unpredictability & curiosity
    being constantly engaged because you don't know what is going to happen next
    your brain pays more attention when something does not fall in your regular pattern recognition cycles
    this is the primary core drive behind gambling addictions

  core drive 8: loss & avoidance
    motivation to avoid something negative from happening
    present in special offers for limited time
      people feel that if they don't act immediatly they would lose the opportunity to act forever

white hat and black hat gamification

  based on the octalysis you can notice that
    the top parts are considered positive motivations (called white hat gamification)
      engaging because
        express your creativity
        feels successful at mastering a skill

    the bottom parts are considered negative motivations (called black hat gamification)
      engaging because
        you don't know what will happen next
        you constantly fear losing something
        you struggle to attain things you can't have

      it will often leave a bad taste in your mouth
        even if you are consistently motivated to take these actions

  being black hat doesn't necessarily mean that is bad
    they are at the end just motivations that can produce healthy results
      e.g. some people use those to go to the gym, eat healthier

sensation: the hidden ninth core drive

  is the physical pleasure obtained by taking an action
  all the other core drives are psychological while this one is physical

how to apply octalysis to actual systems

  think about how a product or experience uses the 8 core drives
  identify the game mechanics and techniques used to activate them

  example with facebook
    meaning
      lacks epic meaning
    accomplishment
      completed profile, more friends, increased likes and comments
    empowerment
      sharing creative content
    ownership
      IKEA effect, memories
    social influence
      envy cloud
    scarcity
      inner circles
    unpredictability
      refreshing content
    avoidance
      sunk cost tragedy

  another example with candy crush
    meaning
      lacks epic meaning
    accomplishment
      1-3 stars, reaching high levels
    empowerment
      constantly looking for better combos and planning boosters
    ownership
      own quest to accumulate more points and boosters
    social influence
      see friend progress
    scarcity
      countdown timer/moves, waiting for the good gems
    unpredictability
      unpredictable gems, random combos
    avoidance
      avoiding loss (?)

quick intro to level 2 octalysis and beyond

  optimizing experiences across all four phases of the player/user journey

  the phases are
    discovery
      why people would even want to try the experience
    onboarding
      where users learn the rules and tools to play the game
    scaffolding
      the regular journey of repeated actions towards a goal
    engame
      how do you retain your experienced users

  if at any of the phases none of the 8 Core Drives are present
    there is no reason for the user to move on to the next phase
    and the user simply drops out

  the reason you are using a product in day 1
    is often different from the reason you are using the product in day 100

explicit gamification
  uses strategies that use applications that are obviously game-like
  users know they are playing a game
  e.g. McDonald's monopoly game
        it's a game but the purpose is 
          to get people go back to McDonald's
